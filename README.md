Note Taker

# Made by : Sergio Bracamontes

## User Story
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Description 
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

        
## Installation
* npm install -y
* node server.js
        
## Usage 
* Write notes into input field
* Click on the floppy-disk icon at the top right to save note.
* New notes should be displayed on the left of the screen.
* If one wants to delete the note, just click on the trash can icon to delete note.

## WHAT I DID
* I started with setting up the html routes in JS.
* I then started on making the foundation for the api routes.
* I then got to work on the server.js file to make sure that the link would work.
* Going back to the api routes I worked on getting the app to post and delete.
* Once finsished I worked on getting the data to have an id.
* Finishing that I manged to have the db.json reading and displaying the right db.son file.
